# Physics & Machine Learning
There is a profound connection between physics and **probabilistic** machine learning. The link is the probability
theory formulated by (theoretical physicist) [Edwin Thompson Jaynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Thompson_Jaynes).
The approach is based on **probability as extended logic**. Very clean summary, given long time ago (1819) by Laplace,
says _Probability theory is nothing but common sense reduced to calculation_. Simple term 
_common sense_ conceals (very complicated) reasoning process our brain does unconsciously and almost
instantaneously every day.

His [Probability Theory: The Logic of Science](https://www.amazon.com/Probability-Theory-Science-T-Jaynes/dp/0521592712)
is cited as the first source in books like
   * [Machine Learning A Probabilistic Perspective (Kevin P. Murphy)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/machine-learning-1)
   * [Deep Learning (I.Goodfellow, Y.Bengio and A.Courville)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/deep-learning)
   
Note that [Axioms of Probability Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms) are consistent with
the above approach. The difference is the origin of these axioms. In the _common sense_ approach these rules are 
inherently connected with the human reasoning while in axiomatic approach they are postulated at the beginning.
Since machine learning attempts to model (human) brain activity mathematical models of _common sense_ are fundamental
source of ideas.
