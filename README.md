# Physics & Machine Learning
There is a profound connection between physics and **probabilistic** machine learning. The link is formulation of
probability theory based on concept **probability as extended logic** developed by (theoretical physicist) 
[Edwin Thompson Jaynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Thompson_Jaynes). According to this formulation 
probability theory provides mathematical model (or models) of **common sense**. Simple term _common sense_ conceals 
(very complicated) reasoning process (human) brain does unconsciously and almost instantaneously every day.
Long time ago (1819) Laplace said _Probability theory is nothing but common sense reduced to calculation_.

According above POV mathematical model(s) of common sense (i.e. probability theory) corresponds to 
mathematical models of physical phenomena (called physical theories). The similarities include e.g.
   * evolution of those models as knowledge advances
   * question whether there is some natural end to this evolution, or whether it will go on indefinitely.
     (Something like [Theory of Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything) in physics).
   * Also, very disturbing fact, that most familiar features to us turn out to be the hardest to understand or compute
    - e.g. watching the waterfall [Fluid dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics)      

His [Probability Theory: The Logic of Science](https://www.amazon.com/Probability-Theory-Science-T-Jaynes/dp/0521592712)
is cited as the first source in books like
   * [Machine Learning A Probabilistic Perspective (Kevin P. Murphy)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/machine-learning-1)
   * [Deep Learning (I.Goodfellow, Y.Bengio and A.Courville)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/deep-learning)
   
[Axioms of Probability Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms) are consistent with
the above approach. The difference is the origin of these axioms. In the _common sense_ approach these rules are 
inherently connected with the human reasoning while in axiomatic approach they are postulated.
Since machine learning attempts to model (human) brain activity mathematical models of _common sense_ are fundamental
source of ideas.
